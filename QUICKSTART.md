# Neo4j (optional but recommended)
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USER = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "your_password"

# Pinecone
PINECONE_API_KEY = "pcsk_..."  # Get from pinecone.io

## Switching Providers

Change one line in `config.py`:

```python
LLM_PROVIDER = "groq"   # Free Llama 3.3 70B
# or
LLM_PROVIDER = "openai" # Paid GPT-4o-mini
```

If switching providers, recreate the Pinecone index (different embedding dimensions):
```bash
# Delete old index
python -c "from pinecone import Pinecone; import config; pc = Pinecone(api_key=config.PINECONE_API_KEY); pc.delete_index(config.PINECONE_INDEX_NAME)"

# Upload with new provider
python pinecone_upload.py
```
