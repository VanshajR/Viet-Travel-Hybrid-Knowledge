## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

Create a `config.py` file (copy from `.env.example` if available):

```python
# config.py

# Choose LLM Provider: "openai" or "groq" (groq is FREE!)
LLM_PROVIDER = "groq"  # or "openai"

# Neo4j Configuration (optional but recommended)
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USER = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "your_password"

# Pinecone Configuration (required)
PINECONE_API_KEY = "pcsk_..."   # Your Pinecone API key
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME = "vietnam-travel"

# LLM API Keys (choose based on LLM_PROVIDER)
GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_..."        # Free from console.groq.com (recommended!)
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-proj-..."  # Paid from platform.openai.com

# Vector Dimensions (auto-configured based on provider)
PINECONE_VECTOR_DIM = 384       # For Groq (HuggingFace all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
# PINECONE_VECTOR_DIM = 1536    # For OpenAI (text-embedding-3-small)
```

**💡 Tip:** Use Groq for free, high-quality responses with Llama 3.3 70B!

## 🔄 Switching Between OpenAI and Groq

Our system supports **both OpenAI and Groq** seamlessly. Here's how to switch:

### **Using Groq (Free)** 🆓
1. Get API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. In your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   LLM_PROVIDER=groq
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_key_here
   ```
3. Run `python pinecone_upload.py` (uses HuggingFace embeddings - 384 dim)
4. Done! Uses Llama 3.3 70B for free

### **Using OpenAI (Paid)** 💰
1. Get API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. In your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   LLM_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your_openai_key_here
   ```
3. Run `python pinecone_upload.py` (uses OpenAI embeddings - 1536 dim)
4. Done! Uses GPT-4o-mini or GPT-4o

### **Important Notes:**
- ⚠️ **Vector dimensions differ**: Groq=384, OpenAI=1536
- ⚠️ **You'll need separate Pinecone indexes** if switching providers
- ✅ **Or** delete and recreate the index when switching
- ✅ **Recommendation**: Stick with one provider for consistency

### **Quick Switch Command:**
```bash
# Delete existing index (if switching providers)
python -c "from pinecone import Pinecone; import config; pc = Pinecone(api_key=config.PINECONE_API_KEY); pc.delete_index(config.PINECONE_INDEX_NAME)"

# Re-upload with new provider
python pinecone_upload.py
```

## 🤔 Technical FAQ

### Why use both Pinecone and Neo4j?

They solve different problems. Pinecone finds semantically similar content - like when someone asks "romantic spots" and we match it to places tagged with "couples" or "scenic views" even without exact keyword matches. Neo4j captures relationships - hotels near attractions, cities connected by train routes, that kind of thing.

The real win is combining them. Say someone asks "plan a beach trip near Hanoi." Pinecone surfaces beach destinations, Neo4j pulls in connected entities (nearby restaurants, transit options), and the LLM synthesizes it all into a coherent itinerary. Using just one would give partial results.

### How would this scale to 1M nodes?

Current setup starts hitting limits around 50-100K nodes. For 1M+ you'd need:

**Pinecone side is fine** - serverless indexes handle millions of vectors without issue. We're already using metadata filtering which keeps queries fast.

**Neo4j needs work:**
- Switch from Desktop to Enterprise for better memory handling
- Add indexes on frequently queried properties (`MATCH (n:City {name: "Hanoi"})` → index on City.name)
- Implement query result limits - instead of fetching all connections, grab top N by relevance
- Consider read replicas for query load distribution
- Partition the graph if needed (region-based sharding)

**Application changes:**
- Cache hot paths (popular queries like "Hanoi attractions")
- Add pagination for results
- Implement rate limiting
- Maybe add Redis for session state instead of in-memory

Budget-wise, Pinecone stays cheap (serverless pricing scales well). Neo4j is where costs jump - you'd probably need Aura Professional ($65+/month) or self-hosted on beefier hardware.

### What are the failure modes?

**Pinecone dies:**
System falls back to graph-only mode. Searches become keyword-based instead of semantic. Still functional but less intelligent - exact matches only, no synonym understanding.

**Neo4j dies:**
More graceful. We show a warning in the UI and continue with vector-only mode. You lose relationship context (connected places, nearby facilities) but semantic search still works. Most queries remain usable.

**LLM provider fails:**
This is where our fallback chain matters. With Groq, we try three models in sequence: llama-3.3-70b → llama-3.1-8b → mixtral-8x7b. If all fail, system returns raw search results with an error message. With OpenAI, single point of failure - if GPT-4o-mini is down, we're stuck.

**Embedding generation fails:**
Query fails completely since we can't convert text to vectors. We catch this and show a clear error. Could improve by caching popular query embeddings or having a fallback embedding model.

**Complete outage scenario:**
If both Pinecone and Neo4j are down, app can't function. No fallback to static data currently. Could add a small emergency dataset in SQLite for basic responses, but haven't implemented that.

**Most common real-world failure:** Rate limits. Hit Groq's free tier limit? System errors out. Should add request queuing and retry logic with exponential backoff.

### What about forward compatibility if Pinecone's API changes again?

Yeah, migrating from v2 to v5 was painful. Here's the defensive strategy:

**Abstraction layer approach:**
Wrap all Pinecone calls in our own interface class. Instead of calling `index.query()` directly everywhere, we use `VectorStore.search()`. When the API changes, update one file instead of 10 scattered functions.

Example pattern:
```python
class VectorStore:
    def search(self, query_vector, top_k):
        # Pinecone v5 implementation today
        return self.index.query(vector=query_vector, top_k=top_k)
    
    # If v6 changes the API, only this changes
```

**Version pinning with monitoring:**
`requirements.txt` locks Pinecone to specific version (pinecone-client==5.0.0). Set up Dependabot or similar to alert on new releases. Test in staging before upgrading.

**Multi-provider support:**
Already structured for this - swap Pinecone for Weaviate, Milvus, or Qdrant with minimal changes. Keep provider-specific code isolated in init functions.

**Standard interfaces:**
Both Pinecone and Neo4j follow relatively stable patterns (vector search, graph queries). The core operations (search, upsert, filter) are unlikely to fundamentally change, just the syntax.

**Realistic take:** Breaking changes will happen. Budget for migration work every 2-3 years. The abstraction layer reduces pain but doesn't eliminate it. Keep tests comprehensive so you catch breakage immediately.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Neo4j service unavailable"
- Ensure Neo4j is running: `neo4j start` or check Neo4j Desktop
- Verify URI in `config.py` matches your Neo4j instance
- System will continue in vector-only mode

### Issue: "Pinecone index not found"
- Run `pinecone_upload.py` first
- Check index name in `config.py` matches
- Verify Pinecone API key is valid

### Issue: "OpenAI API error"
- Verify API key in `config.py`
- Check account has credits
- Ensure internet connection

### Issue: "No results found"
- Ensure data is loaded in both Pinecone and Neo4j
- Try different query phrasing
- Check if index contains data: should show stats after upload
